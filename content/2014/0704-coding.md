Summary: There is a lot of discussion on the net if Testers need to learn to code or not.  I do not argue why or why not, I just explain what I am doing. As a tester, I do code, not in the same language as our developers, but in scripting languages.

There is a lot of discussion on the net if Testers need to learn to code or not.  I do not argue why or why not, I just explain what I am doing. As a tester, I do code, not in the same language as our developers, but in scripting languages. My preferable language is python. So dear testers, do not discus to much to convince the others who have arguments not to do, just do it and enjoy it of course, because that is what matter.
