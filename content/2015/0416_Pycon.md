summary: Videos for Pycon 2015 are online. I placed a link on this page.

The python video's for pycon 2015 are online on youtube. The [Link to the videos is here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxzjK6GuOHVKR_08TT4hJQ/videos?utm_source=Python+Weekly+Newsletter&utm_campaign=a2868b7094-Python_Weekly_Issue_187_April_16_2015&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9e26887fc5-a2868b7094-312718753). Pycon 2015 is even not finished yet, and a lot of videos are already online. They are faster and faster each year. Let's hope the topics are as interesting as each year. 

I do not have a lot of time left, but I definitely want to see a lot of them so I can learn again new things. Last year I learned a lot about asyncio and generators. Maybe I learn again some new features that are present in python 3. 

Happy watching.
