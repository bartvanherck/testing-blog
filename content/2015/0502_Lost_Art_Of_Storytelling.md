summary:  Did we lose how to tell a story? Maybe it is true. Vipul Kocher explained it to us.

The opening keynote was a very interesting one. In fact the complete event was a great day. Vipul started with a quote of Joseph Campel. "Everything begins with a story". Is it? Maybe it is. That is why in agile projects we use user stories. We create a little story about what we are going to do the next days. It is written in a kind of story so that it is more easy to remember. Stories stick more to our minds, isn't it? 

A few stories came into his talk. For example the story about [blind men and an elephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) can be used in a testing context. We must see the complete system or we can interpret the things we test wrongly.

But most of all, the story must be adapted to the recepient. He told a story about acrobat and fonts. One guy wanted to have acrobat on his palm pilot, or was it a palm phone? This man wanted to show shome fonts that was not supported, and the person of the helpdesk explained in detail why it should not work. He even gave an example of a font that the recepient wanted to use. But he did not ask that in first place. How did the helpdesk did know that the person wanted to use that font? Because his name was a common name of the [sikh people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh) and these fonts are commonly used by those persons.

So you must use in your story the viewpoint of your recepient. In that case, you have a better communication.

He also told a story about regression testing. But in the form of going to the dokter. He had some lever problems and each time he went to the dokter, he did a scan. But also his heart and so where investigated. Suddenly after a time, his heart was not good anymore, but he did not see that until it was too late. What he missed was that during the previous scans, the values where raising. Is this also not in our real testing world like this? If we do regression testing, we do not see that for example the system is slowing down until it reaches a threshold and then we ask to ourselfs, why is that now, but what we did not see is that the problem occurs many monts ago.

So story telling is needed and can be usefull to remember somethings. It is also that stories give other knowledge than scientific knowledge. And for that they are remembered better.

I should have to think now how I can apply this story telling in my daily work. Maybe by creating bugs or by explaining why the bug is relevant? I really want to try this the next weeks.
