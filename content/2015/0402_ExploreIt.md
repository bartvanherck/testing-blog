summary: After reading a part of the book Explore It, written by Elisabeth Hendrickson, I wrote a summary of the book.

I am at the moment reading some books. One of them is the book [Explore It!](https://pragprog.com/book/ehxta/explore-it) written by [Elisabeth Hendrickson](http://testobsessed.com/). The book is divided into three parts. At the moment I have finished part 1 and I must say that I did have found a lot of new ideas for my daily testing job. Specially the charter chapter is very usefull, because now I can place a charter as a scrum task on our scrum board. Very pleasant to see that now our developers know what part of the system I am testing at.

I also created a sketch note of the first part of the book. I place the figure of that sketch note into the public domain because I think it can help some other testers too. Note that this is not a summary of the book, but it is my view on what I need at this moment in my current job.
