summary:  A test conference is always a source of new ideas, new inspirations, new people that I meet and many more. Therefore I would like to write down the most important things of the workshop that I attended in the morning.

Yesterday, 30 april there was a conference in Nieuwegein, Netherlands. This event was organised by [Testnet](http://www.testnet.org), an organisation for Testers in the Netherlands. I attended there several very interesting talks. The conferences organised by Testnet are always having a theme. This time, the theme was documentation.

In the morning, I attended a workshop about Visual Modeling for test idea generation. The workshop was given by Vipul Kocher. A very interesting talk. He began with explaining that a model is a simplification of the reality and does not have to be perfect. A model is never the end goal. The real product is. Because most people remember images better than text, it is better to have an image as model. To create models, it is a good idea to ask [Context Free Questions](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2010/11/context-free-questions-for-testing/), like Michael Bolton already explained many times. 

In a second part he asked a question that kept me thinking and I should really ask the question to myself to solve it. The question is simple: "How did we learn to write testcases"? According to hem the best way to learn is by looking at examples. "SHOW IT", is the key word here. 
But showing it is a very intense way of learning. It is also very time consuming. So he asked the next question. How can we make this process much simpler? The answer is very simple, Just use the nouns and verbs test idea that [Elisabeth Hendrickson](http://testobsessed.com/) explained in her book "Explore It!". 

In the second part he mentioned that Joris Meert has written [a fantastic paper](http://www.testingreferences.com/docs/Functional_Testing_Heuristics.pdf) that we can use to create models. 
Of course he explained an example of how he create test ideas. Not all test ideas ends in a test case, because then we end in hundres of tests.

It was an amazing workshop and I got some ideas on how I can generate test ideas when I am planning my test cases.

In my next posts, I will give some impressions of the talks I attended.
