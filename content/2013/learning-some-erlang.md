Summary: As a software tester it is nice to know some programming. I did start to learn some not common programming languages. In the search for a new language, I discovered erlang. This is a nice programming language that is a kind of a functional language. One of the nice things I like is the handling of the variables.

As a software tester it is nice to know some programming. I did start to learn some not common programming languages. In the search for a new language, I discovered erlang. This is a nice programming language that is a kind of a functional language.
One of the nice things I like is the handling of the variables.

Let's have some analogy. If I discover a bug, I want to remember it later too, so I place it in a database. I do not want that it is moved or changed. This feature is embedded in the erlang language.

If you program in other languages, perl, python, c or whatever, you can place some value in a variable. In the case of c lets say it is code like this:
<code class="c"><pre>
    int a;
    a = 7;
</pre></code>


But, there is a problem with it, you can change the value of the variable a afterwards in another number. I do not want that. As a tester, I want to know at each time what is in the variable. So for me changing it is not done. 

This is the fact in erlang. If the value cannot be changed, the program is also less difficult to understand in my opinion. That is what I do like about this.
