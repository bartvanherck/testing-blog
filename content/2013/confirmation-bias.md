Summary: A few months ago I went to [Belgium Testing Days 2013](http://btd2013.com/). This was again an amazing conference with a lot of speakers and some nice tutorials. I was listening there to the presentation [Huib Schoots](http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/). He mentioned several books we should read. Because his presentation gave me some insights and gave me links to other domains, I began to read the book "You are not so smart". One chapter in the book is about confirmation bias. Let&rsquo;s investigate this a little bit further.

</div> A few months ago I went to [Belgium Testing Days 2013](http://btd2013.com/). This was again an amazing conference with a lot of speakers and some nice tutorials. I was listening there to the presentation [Huib Schoots](http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/). He mentioned several books we should read. Because his presentation gave me some insights and gave me links to other domains, I began to read the book "You are not so smart". One chapter in the book is about confirmation bias. Let&rsquo;s investigate this a little bit further.

This confirmation bias is in every person. It is about the fact that if you buy a new car and afterwards sees that car everywhere. This is because previously you ignored that kind of information, and now it is linked in your mind to watch for.

That chapter also mentioned about an experiment that was done, like there are many experiments done in social sciences. But this experiment they let a group of people read about a fictive person X. Some things the person does could be extrovert and other introvert. This makes it a real person after all? After a week of knowing all about the life of that person, the researchers divided the group in two. Group one was asked if person X was good for woring in a library, the other group was asked if the person was good for a job as lawyer.

Both groups agreed that person X could do the work the researchers suggested. The librarian group remembered that the introvert character of person X was a pro, the other group remembered more person X to be extrovert. After this, both groups were asked if person X was good for the the job that was suggested to the other group. Each group decided that person X was not good for that other job.
This study suggests that even in your memory the confirmation bias is present. You always fall in recalling things that you already know and forget the things that are contradicted to them. Maybe it is because we learned in math that contradiction does not exist?

The conclusion is that we must more think like in science, seek evidence of the contrary of what you think. Maybe that is true for testing too?

If you find a bug in the system you are testing, the normal process is that a developer fix the bug. You verify the bug and find new ones, simular to this bug. That is why they also say that bugs stick together and are social. They always come at the same place. But is this? Is this not the confirmation bias? Maybe it is. Maybe you also should look further in the system at totally other domains.

The developer has fixed the bug, but afte a while the bug is in the sytem again for some reason. This should be found too. Because we are confident that it worked previously because they fixed the bug, it is not certain that the bug stays away forever. We must collect evidences that it stays away. Solution for this could be automated tests that run at regular times. But not everything is automatable, and that is a risk.

But there is &nbsp;in my opinion another risk too, not a technical, but at social level. A manager sees that everything goes fine, no or not that many problems in the system, so the product will be delivered at time. At that moment, you as a tester discover a major blocking bug that will have impact in the complete system and we must fix this, so the delivery date is in danger. How will the manager react? Does he also suffer of the confirmation bias? How is it possible that if everything is fine, suddenly it is not? That is a contradiction in his mind. We as testers have to communicate this, and we may have the risk that they blame the messenger in stead of the message.
